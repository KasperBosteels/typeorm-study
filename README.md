# Personal study of typeorm

This is a personal repo that i used to document typeorm.
wich i studied to work with in a project in 2022-2023 for my education in the graduat programming.
This project is completely made in typescript.
My database was a local mysql server running on a raspberry pi.

If all of it looks a bit messy its because i had a lot of projects to finish en study extra cullicular topics, i will try in the future to clean up this mess.


not sure how many notes i will add but might be interesting to look back at in the future.

notes:
16/11/2022:

Good progress from the knowing nihil to where i am now.
I still make some faults at querying data or fall back to writhing sql queries. typeorm for sql is defenitly a + in my book, i might even add it to future projects or refacter old ones.




## Usage/Examples

to install all packages
```bash
npm i
```
run project from the project folder:
```bash 
npm start
```
